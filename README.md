# DG Scan
By Daniel Gilbert

## Summary
A port scanner written in C.

## Notes

- Began project in order to ultimately learn Intel assembly.
- A resource for learning Intel assembly specified being "comfortable with C" as a requirement.
- Already knowing C++, I decided to write a port scanner in C to become more familiar with the language.
- After writing some C code for this project, I realized that I am probably already sufficiently prepared to learn Intel assembly.
- Pausing port scanner project for now.

The idea for this software was conceived on Thursday, January 19, 2023 at approximately 9:00 PM PST.

The idea for this software was conceived entirely using my own time and resources.
